textual-analysis-suite
======================

This suite of tools are generally being built for my own private use for textual analysis of Thelemic Holy Books
as a result of a verse in Liber LXV Chapter 1 that inspired me.

Eventually it'll include:

concordance
n-grams
general statistics
cryptographic analysis 
etc
