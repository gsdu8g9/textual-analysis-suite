VII:II:1. O my God! use Thou me again, alway. For ever! For ever! 
VII:II:2. That which came fire from Thee cometh water from me; let therefore Thy Spirit lay hold on me, so that my right hand loose the lightning. 
VII:II:3. Travelling through space, I saw the onrush of two galaxies, butting each other and goring like bulls upon earth. I was afraid. 
VII:II:4. Thus they ceased fight, and turned upon me, and I was sorely crushed and torn. 
VII:II:5. I had rather have been trampled by the World-Elephant. 
VII:II:6. O my God! Thou art my little pet tortoise! 
VII:II:7. Yet Thou sustainest the World-Elephant. 
VII:II:8. I creep under Thy carapace, like a lover into the bed of his beautiful; I creep in, and sit in Thine heart, as cubby and cosy as may be. 
VII:II:9. Thou shelterest me, that I hear not the trumpeting of that World-Elephant. 
VII:II:10. Thou art not worth an obol in the agora; yet Thou art not to be bought at the ransom of the whole Universe. 
VII:II:11. Thou art like a beautiful Nubian slave leaning her naked purple against the green pillars of marble that are above the bath. 
VII:II:12. Wine jets from her black nipples. 
VII:II:13. I drank wine awhile agone in the house of Pertinax. The cup-boy favoured me, and gave me of the right sweet Chian. 
VII:II:14. There was a Doric boy, skilled in feats of strength, an athlete. The full moon fled away angrily down the wrack. Ah! but we laughed. 
VII:II:15. I was pernicious drunk, O my God! Yet Pertinax brought me to the bridal. 
VII:II:16. I had a crown of thorns for all my dower. 
VII:II:17. Thou art like a goat's horn from Astor, O Thou God of mine, gnarl'd and crook'd and devilish strong. 
VII:II:18. Colder than all the ice of all the glaciers of the Naked Mountain was the wine it poured for me. 
VII:II:19. A wild country and a waning moon. Clouds scudding over the sky. A circuit of pines, and of tall yews beyond. Thou in the midst! 
VII:II:20. O all ye toads and cats, rejoice! Ye slimy things, come hither! 
VII:II:21. Dance, dance to the Lord our God! 
VII:II:22. He is he! He is he! He is he! 
VII:II:23. Why should I go on? 
VII:II:24. Why? Why? comes the sudden cackle of a million imps of hell. 
VII:II:25. And the laughter runs. 
VII:II:26. But sickens not the Universe; but shakes not the stars. 
VII:II:27. God! how I love Thee! 
VII:II:28. I am walking in an asylum; all the men and women about me are insane. 
VII:II:29. Oh madness! madness! madness! desirable art thou! 30. But I love Thee, O God! 
VII:II:31. These men and women rave and howl; they froth out folly. 
VII:II:32. I begin to be afraid. I have no check; I am alone. Alone. Alone. 
VII:II:33. Think, O God, how I am happy in Thy love. 
VII:II:34. O marble Pan! O false leering face! I love Thy dark kisses, bloody and stinking! O marble Pan! Thy kisses are like sunlight on the blue Aegean; their blood is the blood of the sunset over Athens; their stink is like a garden of Roses of Macedonia. 
VII:II:35. I dreamt of sunset and roses and vines; Thou wast there, O my God, Thou didst habit Thyself as an Athenian courtesan, and I loved Thee. 
VII:II:36. Thou art no dream, O Thou too beautiful alike for sleep and waking! 
VII:II:37. I disperse the insane folk of the earth; I walk alone with my little puppets in the garden. 
VII:II:38. I am Gargantuan great; yon galaxy is but the smoke-ring of mine incense. 
VII:II:39. Burn Thou strange herbs, O God! 
VII:II:40. Brew me a magic liquor, boys, with your glances! 
VII:II:41. The very soul is drunken. 
VII:II:42. Thou art drunken, O my God, upon my kisses. 
VII:II:43. The Universe reels; Thou hast looked upon it. 
VII:II:44. Twice, and all is done. 
VII:II:45. Come, O my God, and let us embrace! 
VII:II:46. Lazily, hungrily, ardently, patiently; so will I work. 
VII:II:47. There shall be an End. 
VII:II:48. O God! O God! 
VII:II:49. I am a fool to love Thee; Thou art cruel, Thou withholdest Thyself. 
VII:II:50. Come to me now! I love Thee! I love Thee! 
VII:II:51. O my darling, my darling -- Kiss me! Kiss me! Ah! but again. 
VII:II:52. Sleep, take me! Death, take me! This life is too full; it pains, it slays, it suffices. 
VII:II:53. Let me go back into the world; yea, back into the world.
