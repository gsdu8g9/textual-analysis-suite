DLXX:I:0. O my God! One is Thy Beginning! One is Thy Spirit, and Thy Permutation One! 
DLXX:I:1. Let me extol Thy perfections before men. 
DLXX:I:2. In the Image of a Sixfold Star that flameth across the Vault inane, let me re-veil Thy perfections. 
DLXX:I:3. Thou hast appeared unto me as an agid God, a venerable God, the Lord of time, bearing a sharp sickle. 
DLXX:I:4. Thou hast appeared unto me as a jocund and ruddy God, full of Majesty, a King, a Father in his prime. Thou didst bear the sceptre of the Universe, crowned with the Wheel of Spirit. 
DLXX:I:5. Thou hast appeared unto me with sword and spear, a warrior God in flaming armour among Thine horsemen. 
DLXX:I:6. Thou hast appeared unto me as a young and brilliant God, a god of music and beauty, even as a young god in his strength, playing upon the lyre. 
DLXX:I:7. Thou hast appeared unto me as the white foam of Ocean gathered into limbs whiter than the foam, the limbs of a miracle of women, as a goddess of extreme love, bearing the girdle of gold. 
DLXX:I:8. Thou hast appeared to me as a young boy mischievous and lovely, with Thy winged globe and its serpents set upon a staff. 
DLXX:I:9. Thou hast appeared to me as an huntress among Thy dogs, as a goddess virginal chaste, as a moon among the faded oaks of the wood of years. 
DLXX:I:10. But I was deceived by none of these. All these I cast aside, crying: Begone! So that all these faded from my vision. 
DLXX:I:11. Also I welded together the Flaming Star and the Sixfold Star in the forge of my soul, and behold! a new star 418 that is above all these. 
DLXX:I:12. Yet even so was I not deceived; for the crown hath twelve rays. 
DLXX:I:13. And these twelve rays are one.
