VII:0:1. Into my loneliness comes -- 
VII:0:2. The sound of a flute in dim groves that haunt the uttermost hills. 
VII:0:3. Even from the brave river they reach to the edge of the wilderness. 
VII:0:4. And I behold Pan. 
VII:0:5. The snows are eternal above, above -- 
VII:0:6. And their perfume smokes upward into the nostrils of the stars. 
VII:0:7. But what have I to do with these? 
VII:0:8. To me only the distant flute, the abiding vision of Pan. 
VII:0:9. On all sides Pan to the eye, to the ear; 
VII:0:10. The perfume of Pan pervading, the taste of him utterly filling my mouth, so that the tongue breaks forth into a weird and monstrous speech. 
VII:0:11. The embrace of him intense on every centre of pain and pleasure. 
VII:0:12. The sixth interior sense aflame with the inmost self of Him, 
VII:0:13. Myself flung down the precipice of being 
VII:0:14. Even to the abyss, annihilation. 
VII:0:15. An end to loneliness, as to all. 
VII:0:16. Pan! Pan! Io Pan! Io Pan!
